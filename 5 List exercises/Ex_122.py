## Tokenizing is the process of converting a string into a list of substrings,
# known as tokens. A list of tokens is often easier to work with than a string
# as a string may have irregular spacing. In some cases, substantial work is
# needed to determine where one token ends and the next one begins. In maths,
# tokens are items such as operators, numbers, and bracketts. *,/,! and () are
# easy t identify but + or - less so as they may be part of a number.
#
# This function will tokenize mathematical expressions. Each token should be a
# parenthesis, an operator, or a  number with an optinal leading +/-.
# Parameters: string containing a methematical expressino. Returns: the list of
# tokens.
# May assume string passed is always a valid mathematical expression with
# integers only. Function must be able to handle variable amounts of whitespace.
# main() program demonstrates function and is suitable for importing. #
