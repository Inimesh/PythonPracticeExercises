Ex_104
### Learned about the method, list.sort(reverse=True|False, key=myFunc)
# which when parameters left empty will assort by ascending/alphabetical order,
# based on the value of the number / first letter of the string.
# When reverse = True the order will be flipped.
# if myfunct is defined and entered as a parameter for sort(), the method will
# sort based on this returned parameter: either a string(alphabetical),
# or an integer (numerical value).
# The sorted() function works similarly and returns a sorted data type.
# The main difference is that the list.sort() method modifies the existing list
# only works for lists, whereas the sorted() method returns a list of the sorted
# elements and can be used on any data type e.g. lists and dictionaries.
# list.append(data) will add data as an element to the list, even another list! ###

Ex_105
### Exactly the same as Ex_104 but with sort(reverse=True) ###

Ex_106
### ben used the list.pop() method to remove outliers. The function removes the
# element at a specified index and can be assigned to a variable. If no
# parameter is given it will remove the last element in the list, otherwise it
# will remove the element at the specified index. ###

Ex_107
### Learnt that you can check list as you go along when adding elements ###

Ex_111
### Used string.replace("X","Y"), which simply replaces every instance of
# character "X" with character "Y". X and Y could be "" too.
# string.split(separator, maxsplit) also splits a string into a list using The
# separator argument is the character to use as the split marker and maxsplit
# determines how many splits to do. Defaults (no arguments specified) are
# whitespace and -1 (all occurences) respectively. ##

Ex_116
### Discovered a new definition of the meaning of 'immutable'. A string is
# defined as immutable and a good example of this is that you cannot do, for
# example: string.lower()
# but rather you must do: string = string.lower()
# the data type is hardcoded and the memory of this cannot be changed, you MUST
# reassign the change made to a variable (either a new name or itself) ###

Ex_117
### Use of zip(list1, list2) to create a list of tuples, containing the
# elements from both lists at the same list index. ###

Ex_118
### Use of list.insert(index, elem) function. Inserts an element at a specified
# index. does not return anything (lists are mutable) ###

Ex_119
### The deal() function changed the var deck, that was local to the main()
# function. Need to learn more about how and why variables get changed (local
# and global variables etc.) ###

Ex_122 - Ex_126
STILL NEED TO DO

Ex_127
### Previous version was much longer than a few seconds. Needed optimizing.
# Now uses an iterative method to generate multiples of a number and not
# checking if % n == 0 each time. ###
