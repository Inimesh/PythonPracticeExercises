We have to report an unfortunate incident at Battersea zoo. At 22:30 there was a
co-ordinated break-out of the monkey enclosure due to protests incited by
discontent with the change in banana quality (forced on us by financial difficulties).
The zookeeper on duty at the time was Ellie Gold and was found absent from her post
during the escape. A large quantity of bananas were found in her locker - investigations are
ongoing and whether these findings are related.
