## A recursive function that determines wheter or not it is possible to
# construct a particular total using a specific number of coins. e.g. can you
# have a total of $1.00 using four coins? Yes, if each coin is a quarter,
# however you cannot have $1.00 using five coins. Read input from the user and
# display a message indicating whether or not it is possible. ##
